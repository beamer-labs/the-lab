# Playing with Artifical Intelligence - Part II

See the mistake I made in part I (at the end)

So I changed it up so it only takes one action per turn.

I also found another bug where it was not recording the last pos correctly.

I also passed in the last move as an input, there are now 17 inputs.

The 9 spaces surronding it.

It's health

It's age

If there is food on the map

//The last 5 things it output. (Can remember it's last move)
